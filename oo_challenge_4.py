# I'd like to be able to set the name attribute at the same time that
# I create an instance. Can you add the code for doing that?
# Remember, you'll need to override the __init__ method.

# Sometimes I have other attributes I need to store on a Student instance, though.
# Can you use **kwargs and setattr to add attributes for any other key/value
# pairs I want to send to the instance when I create it?
