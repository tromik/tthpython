# Start by creating a set variable named songs that has three song titles in it.
# You can use any titles you want, just make sure they're three different strings.

songs = {"Cherub Rock", "Enter Entirely", "Smells Like Teen Spirit"}

# Now use the .add() method to add the title "Treehouse Hula" to songs.

songs.add("Treehouse Hula")

# Alright, and last task. Use .update() to add the following two sets to your songs set.
# {"Python Two-Step", "Ruby Rhumba"}
# {"My PDF Files"}

songs.update({"Python Two-Step", "Ruby Rhumba"}, {"My PDF Files"})
